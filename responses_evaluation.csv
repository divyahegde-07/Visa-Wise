0,I'm on F1 visa but due to an illness I had to go back home for a year. Can I re-enter USA and continue my studies? My f1 is not valid anymore. What should I do?,"To re-enter the United States as an F-1 student, you need to meet certain requirements since your F-1 visa has expired. You will need to apply for a new Form I-20 endorsed by your Designated School Official (DSO) and obtain a new F-1 visa.

Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Get your DSO to endorse a new Form I-20: Reach out to your DSO and provide them with the necessary documentation, including proof of illness and your travel plans. They will need to endorse your new Form I-20 within the last 6 months.
2. Obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) if applicable: If you had been authorized for Optional Practical Training (OPT), you may need to apply for a new EAD card.
3. Apply for a new F-1 visa: With your new Form I-20 and any required documentation, such as proof of illness and travel plans, you can apply for a new F-1 visa at the U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country.

Note that if you have been out of status for more than 5 months, you may need to apply for reinstatement. The process and requirements for reinstatement are outlined in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(E).

Remember to also check with the USCIS Policy Manual and your DSO for specific guidance on re-entering the United States as an F-1 student after a period of absence due to illness.

Reference:
* 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(E) - Reinstatement of F-1 status
* USCIS Policy Manual - F-1 students and reinstatement","Based on the provided context information, you can re-enter the United States and continue your studies if you meet certain conditions.

As an F-1 student, you must have a current visa (if applicable), a Form I-20 endorsed for travel by your DSO within the last 6 months, and an unexpired Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766).

Since your F-1 status is not valid anymore due to the illness, you will need to take certain steps to re-enter the United States and continue your studies:

1. Obtain a new Form I-20: You must obtain a new Form I-20 from your DSO, which has been endorsed for travel within the last 6 months.
2. Re-validate your Form I-20: You should validate your Form I-20 with your DSO every six months to confirm that the information required by paragraph (f)(12)(ii)(A) of this section has not changed.
3. Pay a new fee: As an F-1 student who has been absent from the United States for more than 5 months, you must pay a new fee to DHS prior to being granted student status.

Additionally, you should also consider applying for reinstatement to F-1 status if you failed to maintain your lawful immigration status due to circumstances beyond your control, such as illness or injury. To qualify for reinstatement, you must establish that the violation resulted from circumstances beyond your control and demonstrate that you intend to continue pursuing a full course of study at the school authorized by your DSO.

Please note that it's always best to consult with your DSO and USCIS directly for personalized guidance on your specific situation."
1,I'm on a dependant visa. Will enrolling myself into a university require a F1 visa?,"Based on the provided context information, I'll do my best to help you.

As an individual with a dependent visa, understanding the process for enrolling in a university is crucial. To clarify, if the relevant Visa Bulletin chart shows a specific cut-off date for your preference category and country of birth (and chargeability), it means that immigrant visa numbers are currently available for those immigrants who have a priority date earlier than the indicated date.

In this scenario, to enroll in a university as an M-2 dependent, you'll need to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study. At the time of admission, you must individually present an original Form I-20 issued by a school certified by ICE SEVP for attendance by M-1 students.

As an M-2 dependent, your eligibility for admission in the United States is tied to that of the principal F-1 student. You're admitted for the fixed period of stay for which the M-1 student (your spouse or parent) is admitted.

To confirm your eligibility, it's recommended that you consult with a qualified immigration attorney or USCIS representative to determine whether any additional steps are required for your enrollment.

In summary, as an M-2 dependent, enrolling in a university might not require a new F1 visa, but this depends on the specific circumstances and the duration of your M-2 status. It's essential to consult with a qualified immigration professional to confirm your eligibility.","Based on the provided policy manual and regulations, as a dependent family member of an F-1 student, you are eligible for admission in F-2 status. As a dependent, you do not need to apply for a separate visa or immigration status.

Enrolling yourself into a university as an F-2 dependent does not require a F1 visa. You will need to provide evidence that your F-1 student sponsor has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study at the same institution where you intend to enroll.

Please note that you should consult with the Designated School Official (DSO) at the university you plan to attend for specific guidance on the enrollment process and any additional requirements."
2,Can I buy a house with F1 visa? ,"Based on the provided context information, dependents of an F-1 student who is unable to complete the student's course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20 do not need to apply for an extension of stay if they were admitted for duration of status. If the Designated School Official (DSO) grants an extension of stay for the F-1 student, the DSO updates the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) for both the F-1 student and their F-2 dependents.

In this context, it appears that an F-1 visa holder's spouse cannot buy a house in the United States using their own funds or credit. The relevant guidance suggests that the visa holder's dependent family members are not permitted to engage in employment in the United States.","Here's the rewritten answer based on the new context:

No, you cannot buy a house with an expiring PRC that allows for time to process the new card. As USCIS has phased out issuing extension stickers and started issuing revised notices, it is essential to understand your visa status and its limitations.

F-1 visas are specific to international students pursuing full-time academic studies in the United States. The regulations do not provide authorization for F-1 students to purchase real estate or engage in business activities unrelated to their studies.

When considering property ownership, it's crucial to evaluate your visa type and the relevant regulations. In this case, with an expiring PRC allowing time to process the new card, your circumstances may be different from those of an F-1 student. However, without prior knowledge of your specific situation, it is still not possible to buy a house with an F-1 visa.

Please consult the USCIS policy manual for more information on travel documents for LPRs and U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Carrier Information Guide for further guidance."
3,I'm in the process of filing my H-1B. Can I visit my home since I have a family emergency? I plan to be back in a about a month,"Here's a rewritten answer based on the new context:

Since you're in the process of filing your reentry permit, it appears that you are not yet maintaining lawful permanent resident status. As a general rule, if you don't meet the definition of a pressing or critical need to travel, you wouldn't be eligible for expedited processing.

However, having a family emergency is considered a compelling circumstance that may justify an expedite request. You'd need to demonstrate that the emergency requires immediate attention and that departing without delay is necessary.

Given your plan to return within a month, it's likely that your reentry permit won't be approved by then. To expedite your request, submit supporting documentation that demonstrates the nature and urgency of your family emergency. You can also seek guidance from USCIS or consult with an immigration expert for more information on expediting your application.

Please note that if you depart without proper authorization, it may lead to a determination that you have abandoned your lawful permanent resident status. Ensure any travel or absence is properly authorized and doesn't compromise your immigration status.","When a household member needs to travel internationally due to an unforeseen family emergency, it's crucial to consider the potential impact on their H-1B petition. In some cases, extraordinary circumstances may warrant an exception to departing the United States while the petition is pending.

To navigate this situation, one option could be to seek advance parole, which would enable the individual to travel internationally without abandoning their application. This can be achieved by filing Form I-131 and providing evidence of the extraordinary circumstances that necessitate departure.

It's essential to note that departing the United States without an approved Advance Parole Document or a valid visa may be considered abandonment of the application, which could result in denial. As such, it's crucial to carefully evaluate the situation and explore available options before making any decisions.

For further guidance on advance parole and travel during the H-1B process, individuals can refer to the provided FAQs at https://www.uscis.gov/."

5,WHat is O1 visa? How is it different from any other visa?,"**Rewrite**

An O-2 beneficiary is an individual who is essential to an O-1 beneficiary's artistic or athletic performance and is coming solely to assist in that performance. The O-2 beneficiary must be an integral part of the actual performance or event and possess critical skills and experience with the O-1 that are not general in nature and that U.S. workers do not possess.","The O-1 visa category is designed for nonimmigrants who have achieved extraordinary success in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. This type of visa allows individuals with exceptional skills and achievements to enter the United States temporarily to continue their work in their area of expertise.

One key difference between an O-1 visa and other visas is the high standard of eligibility required. To qualify for an O-1 visa, petitioners must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and recognition in their field of expertise, which can be evidenced through a range of documentation, including awards, memberships, published materials, and more.

The purpose of an O-1 visa is to enable individuals with exceptional skills and achievements to enter the United States temporarily to continue their work, whether it's pursuing a scientific project, performing at a concert, or leading a business venture. The duration of stay for an O-1 nonimmigrant is not specified, but it may be necessary to provide for the event or events for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.

In essence, the O-1 visa category is designed to attract and retain the best and brightest individuals in various fields, allowing them to share their expertise with the United States while also fostering innovation, creativity, and progress."
6,I am not a US citizen. Can I get a Green Card or permanent residence if I marry a US citizen?,"I'd be happy to help you with that! According to USCIS policy guidelines, in order to remove conditions on residence, the Conditional Permanent Resident (CPR) must establish that their qualifying marriage is or was bona fide.

A bona fide marriage is defined as a marriage that:

1. Was entered into in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place;
2. Has not been judicially annulled or terminated, other than through the death of a spouse;
3. Was not entered into for the purpose of procuring admission as an immigrant; and
4. For which no fee or other consideration was given to the petitioning spouse, CPR spouse, or other interested party for filing the immigrant or fiancé(e) visa petition that formed the basis of the CPR's admission to the United States.

To request removal of conditions on residence, the CPR must provide USCIS with evidence that the qualifying marriage is or was bona fide. This may include documentation showing joint ownership of property, lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence, documentation showing commingling of financial resources, birth certificates of child(ren) born to the marriage, and/or affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the marital relationship.

Additionally, the CPR must provide the following information on the petition:

1. The actual residence(s) of the CPR and the petitioning spouse or stepparent from the time that the CPR obtained status;
2. The CPR and the petitioning spouse or stepparent's addresses for at least 90 days before the marriage.

To qualify for a Green Card or permanent residence, you will need to meet these requirements and provide the necessary evidence of your bona fide marriage.

Please note that USCIS policies are subject to change, so it is always best to check with USCIS directly or consult with an immigration attorney for the most up-to-date information.","To obtain a Green Card or permanent residence as an alien spouse, you must demonstrate that your qualifying marriage was bona fide and not entered into solely for the purpose of evading U.S. immigration laws. This typically requires providing evidence of joint ownership, shared financial resources, and other documentation showing a genuine marital relationship. Additionally, you must provide information about your actual residence(s) with your US citizen spouse from the time you obtained status. Your marriage must also comply with the laws of the place where it took place."
7,I graduated from my master's course. I'm still looking for jobs. How do I stop my unemployment days once my EAD arrives and I find a job?,"Since you are an F-1 student who has completed their program and is authorized for post-completion OPT, your employment authorization begins on the date indicated on your Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Once you find a job, the days of unemployment will stop.","When you find a job after your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) arrives, you can continue working until the date of USCIS's written decision on your current Form I-765 or for up to 180 days after your current post-completion OPT expires, whichever is earlier.

To stop counting unemployment days once you start working:

1. Ensure that you properly file an application to extend or change your non-immigrant status (Form I-539) if applicable.
2. If you have completed an authorized period of post-completion OPT, you may remain in F-1 status for 60 days beyond the EAD expiration date. During this grace period, you can prepare for departure from the United States.

Keep in mind that the counting of days out of status usually stops on the earliest of the following:

* The day you properly file an adjustment application;
* The day you obtain lawful immigration status; or
* The day you depart the United States.

Once you find a job, ensure that you are maintaining a lawful immigration status. If you fail to continuously maintain a lawful status at any point, your time period between two lawful statuses will be counted towards the 180-day limit in determining if you are eligible for an exemption.

Remember to follow the instructions and guidelines provided by USCIS regarding employment authorization and keep track of your days out of status accordingly."
8,There is a severe economic crisis happening in my home country which has blocked my funding. Can I taken an off-campus employment to support myself and is it illegal to do so?,"Military conflicts can lead to unforeseen circumstances that disrupt funding and create financial difficulties. In such situations, F-1 nonimmigrant students may seek off-campus employment authorization based on ""Severe Economic Hardship"" provisions.

To qualify for off-campus employment, students must request a recommendation from their Designated School Official (DSO) due to economic hardship. The DSO must complete the certification in SEVIS and notate it on the student's Form I-20. Then, the student can submit Form I-765 with the required fee and supporting materials, including affidavits detailing the unforeseen circumstances.

If approved, students will receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS, allowing them to engage in off-campus employment. This authorization enables full-time work during holidays or school vacation periods and part-time work up to 20 hours per week during school sessions.

Please note that USCIS may only grant off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship for up to one year, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security suspends this requirement through a Federal Register notice.","Practical training. Practical training may be authorized to an F-1 student who has been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis, in an approved SEVP-certified college, university, conservatory, or seminary for one full academic year. This paragraph also includes students who, during their course of study, were enrolled in a study abroad program, if the student had spent at least one full academic term enrolled in a full course of study in the United States prior to studying abroad."
9,I'm a F1 student and I'm going through an economic crisis. Can I take an off-campus employment to support myself and is it illegal to do so?,"As a F-1 student, you are eligible for off-campus employment if you can demonstrate that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from emergent circumstances beyond your control. To take an off-campus employment, you must follow these steps:

1. Request a recommendation from your Designated School Official (DSO) for off-campus employment.
2. The DSO must complete the certification in SEVIS.
3. You must apply for employment authorization with USCIS by submitting Form I-765 and including a copy of a properly endorsed Form I-20 with the filing.
4. You will receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS if your application is approved.

According to the regulations, you may be granted off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship for up to 1 year, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security suspends the applicability of this requirement through publication of a Federal Register notice. If the 1-year limitation is suspended, you may be granted SSR employment authorization for the duration of the Federal Register notice validity period, but not exceeding your F-1 student's academic program end date.

As for whether it is illegal to take an off-campus employment without following these steps, the answer is yes. The regulations explicitly state that a student has permission to engage in off-campus employment only if they receive an EAD endorsed to that effect. Engaging in off-campus employment without proper authorization may result in termination of your F-1 status and potential immigration consequences.

I hope this answers your query.","To support yourself due to economic crisis, you may request off-campus employment authorization as an F-1 nonimmigrant student. However, you must meet specific requirements:

Firstly, you must be maintaining your academic status and not subject to any conditions that would affect your eligibility for this type of employment.

Secondly, your school's Designated School Official (DSO) must endorse a Form I-20 or successor form certifying your eligibility for employment and updating your record in SEVIS as authorized for off-campus employment related to your major area of study.

Lastly, you need to demonstrate that your employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond your control. If you meet these requirements and receive employment authorization from USCIS, you will be issued an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).

Please note that this type of employment may only be authorized for up to one year or until the expected date of completion of your current course of study, whichever is earlier.

Unauthorized off-campus employment can have severe consequences, including termination of F-1 status and potential deportation from the United States."
